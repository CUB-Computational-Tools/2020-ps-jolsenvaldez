    "## Introduction\n",
    "Between 1879 and 1884, two Austrian physicists simultaneously derived a thermodynamics law that related the power per unit area to an absolute temperature for perfect black bodies (those that absorb all radiant energy). The Stefan-Boltzmann law, named after both scientists, is a powerful equation that allows for the calculation of the radiation emitted and/or received by planets of different sizes, as well as the black body temperature of those planets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n",
    "1) Define the quantitative terms in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, along with providing their units. \n",
    "2) Understand how the Stefan-Boltzmann law can be applied to thermodynamic calculations using astronomical geometry. \n",
    "3) Solve for the Power (in Watts) of the sun. \n",
    "4) Solve for the black body Temperature (in degrees Celsius) of the earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Defining Terms\n",
    "The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that $\\textit{the thermal energy radiated by a black body (in Watts per unit area squared) is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (in kelvins)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, with labeled variables and units:\n",
    "Note that the three main units are Watts (for power), square meters (for surface area), and Kelvins (for temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{P}{A} = e \\sigma T^4$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = Power  (Watts)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = Area  (meters^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$e = emissivity  (unitless)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma = Stephan-Boltzmann constant (5.67x 10^{-8} W/m^2/T^4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T = Temperature (degrees Kelvin^4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation compares an energy (power per unit area squared, with units in $\\frac{W}{m^2}$) to temperature raised to the fourth (with units in $Kelvin^4$). The Stefan-Boltzmann constant creates a proportionality between these variables (notice that the units of the constant make it so that the units on either side of the equals sign simplify to $\\frac{W}{m^2}$). Emissivity refers to the effectiveness of an object to emit an energy. For black bodies, which absorb all incident heat radiation, emissivity is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing! When we talk about Area (in $m^2$), we're mostly talking about the surface area of a planet or black body. This is because energy comes out from all sides of a planet's surface. Therefore, Area (A) is usually represented by the equation for surface area, $4 \\pi R^2$, where R is the radius of a planet. What we take to be the area (or the radius) might change depending on what area we define as emitting or receiving energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get into what this equation is really saying and why it is powerful: \n",
    "-If we know the temperature and the surface area (which we can get from the radius) of a planet, we can find the wattage of that planet. \n",
    "-We can also solve for the black body temperature of a planet if we know the amount of energy it receives. \n",
    "-Historically in Geology, solving thermodynamics problems like these was the first step in understanding the age of the earth, processes of heat moving in the earth, and many other cornerstone geological questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "We are going to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and some astronomical geometry to calculate the Solar Constant (So), defined as the energy that the earth receives from the sun in $Watts/meters^2$. We are going to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = e \\sigma T^4*A$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll calculate the Power from the sun using a temperature of 5770K and a surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) with a radius equal to that of the sun ($6.96x10^8$)."
